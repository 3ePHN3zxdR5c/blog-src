Hi! 
I'm an aspiring mathematical analyst and a senior undergraduate in Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as a member of the [Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/) at CMU.
Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the field of "applied analysis"-that is, the application of analytical tools and ideas to other branches of mathematics and computer science, ranging from differential geometry and the calculus of variations to the geometry processing and computer graphics.
I also like playing Tetris.

This site exists both in the hopes that someone will find the content here useful and to serve as some sort of documentation for myself; hopefully both of those goals are achieved to some extent or another.

Here's a short list of some stuff I've done:
# Research
## Surfactant Dynamics from the Arnold Perspective 
- [Paper](https://www.doi.org/10.1137/20S1378144)
- [Poster](assets/surfactants.pdf)

## Central Limit Theorems for Compound Paths on the 2-Dimensional Lattice
- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10645.pdf)
- [Slides]()

# Handouts 
That I'm too lazy to turn into a post
- [Smooth Bump Partitions and Partitions of Unity](assets/MSAnalysisSeminar.pdf)

# The site
This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/), [{% katex %}\KaTeX{% endkatex %}](https://katex.org/), [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
If you're interested, you can see the source for the entire setup [here](https://github.com/elu00/blog-src).
