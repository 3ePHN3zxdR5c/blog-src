Hi! 
I'm a student in Mathematical Sciences and a member of the [Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.
Broadly speaking, I'm interested in problems that happen at the intersection of mathematics and computer science, whether that happens to manifest itself within the fields of geometry processing, finance, or competitive mathematics.
I also like playing Tetris.

This site exists both in the hopes that someone will find the content here useful and to serve as some sort of documentation for myself; hopefully both of those goals are achieved to some extent or another.

Here's a short list of some stuff I've done:
# Handouts

# The site
This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/), [{% katex %}\KaTeX{% endkatex %}](https://katex.org/), [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  
If you're interested, you can see the source for the entire setup [here](https://github.com/elu00/blog-src).
